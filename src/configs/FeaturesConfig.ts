      "Focus on acquiring more customers to boost CLV can still lead to higher churn risk (i.e. shorter lifetime) if customer experience is bad. Instead, the aim should be to know what your customers find valuable and deliver the best customer experience.",

    description:
      "Proactive retention also allows you to address risk drivers that are less expensive because customer risk is intercepted when the customer hasn’t canceled. Early detection coupled with micro-segmentation also enables you to A/B test personalized offers for higher net present value (NPV), and thus reduce the cost of retention.",

      "By calculating customer CLV, you understand customer satisfaction, journey and profile and margin associated with every customer. You get insights into how much you’re spending on acquiring, serving and retaining each customer and how much revenue you’re generating from them. Once you identify different customer segments based on this, it’s easier to allocate a budget to marketing, sales and retention activities.",
